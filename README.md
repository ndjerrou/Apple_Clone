# Apple_Clone

This project is an attempt to reproduce an old version of the [Apple's Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) using HTML and CSS.

This project was created according to the Odin project in order to become a super Software Developer - Link to the [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients](Odin Project)

Through this project, I learn how to use efficiently a background image and also how to manipulate colors to get an exciting gradient.
